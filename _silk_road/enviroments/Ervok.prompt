Ervok is a small city-town east of Convodor
Ervok has very few residential buildings, as it is used primarily as a trade hub for wandering tradesmen
Ervok sits in the middle of a shrubland and thus its buildings are made of sandstone.
Ervok is an artifical town. It was planned and built for traders by the government.
Land is cheap here but it is impossible to grow food.
